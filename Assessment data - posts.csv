For most of my life I used to feel that there is no difference between Prem and Moh 

I used to use them interchangeably 😅

When I realised Moh is Attachment then I used to think that we will be only be attached to those who we truly love. That's why I started thinking Moh was part of Love.

But my perspective truly shifted after watching RadhaKrishn serial and getting definition of Prem from Shri Krishna 🤌

In the RadhaKrishn serial, there's a transformative moment where Lord Krishna gently removes Shrimati Radha Rani Ji's human flaws—krodh (anger), moh (attachment), ahankaar (ego), and more—to awaken the divine love within her ✨


---

What Is Moh? 🤝🫂

Moh is attachment rooted in ego and fear. 

- It says, “You are mine.”

- It clings, controls, and demands.

- It fears loss and seeks possession. 


In the serial, Shrimati Radha Rani Ji's initial love for Lord Krishna was tinged with moh. 

She desired him to be hers, to fulfill her expectations. 

This led to pain, jealousy, and a sense of incompleteness. 


---

What Is Prem? 🥹❤️

- Prem is unconditional love. 

- It says, “You are free.”

- It gives without expecting.

- It finds joy in the beloved’s happiness, even if it means letting go. 


Lord Krishna guided Shrimati Radha Rani Ji to this realization. 

He helped her see that true love isn't about possession but about liberation. 

In doing so, her love transformed into prem—pure, selfless, and divine. 


---

A Personal Reflection

I once believed I had found ""the one."" I invested years—my time, emotions, and mental space—into someone who didn't value it. Looking back, I realize it wasn't prem; it was moh. 

I was attached to the idea of us, to the comfort of familiarity, and to the fear of starting anew.

But love isn't about holding on when it's hurting you; it's about letting go when it's no longer mutual. 


---

The Takeaway 😌

True love (prem) is liberating. It allows both individuals to grow, even if that growth leads them apart. 

Attachment (moh) binds us, often blinding us to reality. 

In relationships, it's essential to discern between the two. Ask yourself: Is this love nurturing me, or is it holding me back? 

Embrace prem, release moh, and find peace in the freedom of unconditional love 🥹🤌

In early 2023, Hindenburg Research accused Adani Group of orchestrating the biggest corporate fraud in history. The claims ranged from stock manipulation and undisclosed related-party deals to offshore fund siphoning.

After an 18-month probe, SEBI issued its final order in September 2025. Here’s the breakdown:

Hindenburg’s Allegations vs SEBI’s Findings

Stock price manipulation

Hindenburg: Adani used offshore shell firms to pump up stock prices.

SEBI: Couldn’t establish manipulation. Offshore entities didn’t legally qualify as “related parties” under Indian law at the time.

2. Undisclosed related-party transactions

Hindenburg: Money moved secretly between Adani firms and friendly entities.

SEBI: Transactions were not legally related-party deals, so no disclosure violation.

3. Round-tripping / Fund siphoning

Hindenburg: Adani routed money through offshore havens back into its own companies.

SEBI: Funds were traced and repaid with interest. No siphoning or investor harm proven.

4. Regulatory breaches

Hindenburg: Violated LODR and PFUTP regulations.

SEBI: No violations found.

SEBI’s conclusion: Allegations not established. Adani gets a clean chit under Indian securities law.

Why Critics Aren’t Convinced

Definition loopholes – Many flagged entities didn’t count as related parties under older rules, even if clearly linked to Adani insiders. Legal technicality ≠ clean governance.

Jurisdiction limits – Offshore funds in Mauritius, UAE, and Cayman remain largely outside SEBI’s reach. That’s where most of the alleged action was.

Political sensitivity – Adani’s proximity to the government raises suspicions that SEBI may have gone easy.

Global scrutiny – US class-action suits and investor caution continue despite India’s clean chit.

Market vs law – SEBI ruled on compliance, not on corporate ethics. Investors still see Adani as opaque and high-risk.

Bottom line: SEBI’s ruling clears Adani in India on the technical letter of the law. But it doesn’t erase doubts about governance, offshore opacity or political influence. Legally, Adani walks free.

Enough is enough. After 26 innocent lives were lost in the Pakistan-backed terror attack in Pahalgam, India responded with steel:


1. Suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty:

For the first time since its inception in 1960, India has suspended the Indus Waters Treaty, signaling a strong stance against Pakistan's alleged involvement in supporting terrorism.


2. Downgrading Diplomatic Relations: 

India has expelled Pakistani military, naval, and air advisors from its High Commission in New Delhi and reduced its diplomatic staff in Pakistan from 55 to 30.


3. Closure of the Attari-Wagah Border and Visa Restrictions: 

The Attari-Wagah border crossing has been closed, halting all land-based movements between the two countries. Additionally, the SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme for Pakistani nationals has been suspended, and those already in India under this scheme have been given 48 hours to leave the country.


This is New India. We don’t plead. We punish.

4187,51,"Lord Krishna and Arjuna Meet Maha Vishnu


In the prosperous city of Dwaraka, a brahmin was struck by misfortune—each time his wife gave birth to a child, the newborn would die instantly. Consumed by grief, the brahmin brought the lifeless bodies of his infants to King Ugrasena’s court, angrily accusing him, “This treacherous, neglectful king is responsible for my sons’ deaths! A ruler who fails in his duties causes such calamities.”

This tragedy repeated nine times, with the brahmin cursing the king on each occasion. When his wife was about to give birth to their tenth child, Arjuna, who was present in the court, boldly stepped forward. “I will protect your child, noble brahmin,” Arjuna vowed. “And if I fail, I will atone for my sin by entering the fire.”

When the time came for the birth, Arjuna surrounded the maternity chamber with a protective cage of arrows, formed using his celestial weapons. Confident in his ability, Arjuna stood guard. Yet, to his dismay, as soon as the baby was born and let out its first cry, it disappeared into the sky.

The brahmin, consumed with anger, mocked Arjuna harshly, accusing him of arrogance and failure. Determined to fulfill his promise, Arjuna set out to find the child. He journeyed through the realms, even reaching Yamaraja’s abode, the kingdom of the dead, but found no trace of the infant. After searching all fourteen worlds in vain, Arjuna was devastated. Bound by his word, he prepared to end his life by entering a sacred fire.

At this critical moment, Lord Krishna intervened, stopping Arjuna. “Do not despair, my friend,” Krishna reassured him. “I will show you the brahmin’s sons. Come with me.” Placing Arjuna on His divine chariot, Krishna began a journey that transcended mortal limits.

They crossed the seven islands and the seven oceans, passed the towering Lokaloka mountain range, and entered a realm of impenetrable darkness. To illuminate their path, Krishna released His blazing Sudarshana Chakra, which cut through the dense gloom. Eventually, they arrived at the waters of the causal ocean (Sheer Sagar), where they beheld the magnificent city of Lord Maha Vishnu.

There, on the thousand-headed Shesh Naag (Anantshesh), reclined the supreme Lord Maha Vishnu, radiating divine brilliance. Maha Vishnu welcomed Krishna and Arjuna with a benevolent smile. “I brought the brahmin’s sons here because I wished to see both of you,” He explained.

Arjuna and Krishna, humbled by the Lord’s grandeur and grace, listened as Maha Vishnu spoke of His divine play. After granting them the brahmin’s children, He blessed them and sent them back to Dwaraka. Thus, the brahmin’s sorrow was turned to joy, and Arjuna’s promise was fulfilled by the divine intervention of Lord Krishna.

I’m sorry to say this, but there's one myth that’s causing many CFA L1 & 2 candidates to be underprepared for the exam.

300 Hours is a Myth

I don’t know who came up with the idea that 300 hours of preparation is enough for each CFA Levels.

Maybe it works if you already have a strong background in finance and understand most of the topics before you start.

But for the average candidate, 300 hours just won’t cut it.

If you ask me, aiming for at least 500 hours of focused, quality study is essential for this exam.

I personally studied for 550 hours before taking CFA L1 & L2, and even then, I felt like I could have studied more.

I used Forest app to track my study hours minute by minute. At the End of day I used to add those hours in my Excel Sheet.

I’ve attached a screenshot of my CFA L2 Excel sheet below, showing exactly how many hours I spent on each subject. Take a look.

1. Turkey, China & USA will side with Pakistan.

Not because they love Pakistan — but because geopolitics is not about friendship, it’s about leverage.

The West needs Pakistan for Afghan access, China funds it to choke India, and Turkey plays the religion card.


2. India can only trust Russia & Israel.

Russia gives us backbone in arms supply.
Israel gives us eyes and ears in intelligence.

Both don’t just support us on paper — they show up when it matters.


3. India lacks an infowar strategy.

We still fight wars with guns while enemies fight with narrative.

From UN lobbies to global media, the enemy controls perception.

It’s time India builds a global digital strike force — not just a diplomatic corps.


4. Bollywood, sports icons, NRIs, and CEOs stay silent.

The very people who earn name and fame through Bharat suddenly find “neutrality” when Bharat bleeds.

Silence in times of terror is complicity.


5. But when India is attacked — we unite like fire.

Left, Right, Hindu, Muslim — everything dissolves.

Because Bharat is not a land. It’s a heartbeat.
And no one gets away with hurting it.


6. IMF funds terror — indirectly.

Bailouts to bankrupt terror states are not aid — they’re oxygen masks.

The world must stop rewarding nations that sponsor hatred.

That’s 1 in every 2 elected leaders in the world’s largest democracy.

This isn’t just a statistic — it’s a mirror.

According to self-declared affidavits from Lok Sabha 2024 winning candidates, nearly 251 out of 543 MPs have pending criminal cases, ranging from serious charges like attempt to murder, hate speech, and assault to minor offenses.


What’s more worrying:

Kerala (95%), Telangana (82%), Odisha (76%), and Jharkhand (71%) top the list — states known for political volatility or strong regional party dominance.

Even developed or literate states are not immune — Tamil Nadu (66%), Delhi (42%), and Bihar (52%) are major contributors.


Zero criminal MPs? 
Only in a handful of UTs and Northeastern states.


Why does this matter?

Because the criminalisation of politics erodes democratic integrity, normalises power over principle, and weakens citizen trust.

Let’s be clear — not all criminal cases mean guilt. Many are politically motivated.

But the sheer scale indicates a systemic issue, not isolated exceptions.


What can be done?

1. Speedy trials for cases against politicians.

2. Disqualification upon conviction, even before appeal processes stretch for years.

3. Political parties must stop fielding candidates with serious charges.

3971,,"I recently came across a newspaper article by Amitabh Kant (ex-NITI Aayog CEO) titled ""Five Key Innovations That Can Transform India"", and it really got me thinking. The piece highlights some powerful ideas that could genuinely uplift millions of lives, but also reminded me of the gaps we still need to fill if we’re serious about becoming a $30+ trillion economy by 2047.

Here’s a quick breakdown of the five innovations mentioned and my personal thoughts on how we can (and must) go further -

Sewage-Free India The article rightly points out that untreated sewage is India’s biggest source of water pollution. We need decentralized, low-cost technologies that can convert sewage into clean water — not just for the environment, but also for groundwater preservation and urban health.

My personal take: We must go beyond pilot programs. We need local governance to adopt these systems at scale. Public-private partnerships and community ownership are key. Also, teach kids about it in schools — that's how change sticks.

2. Safe Water for Millions Only 18% of rural households currently have safe piped water access. Innovations like low-cost Jal Jeevan-compatible water test kits, solar-powered pumps, and local filtration units are being rolled out.

My personal take: Water isn't just a utility — it's a human right. We should involve rural youth and women’s SHGs (Self Help Groups) in managing these systems for long-term sustainability.

3. Light Green Batteries India imports a lot of battery components. The article talks about using locally found minerals to make green batteries — cutting costs and reducing dependency on China.

My personal take: We must link this with green energy adoption in villages, like solar microgrids, clean cooking tech, and EVs for last-mile transport. Give startups in this space more R&D funding and incentives.

4. Smart Agriculture Millions of Indian farmers are still at the mercy of unpredictable weather. Precision farming, smart soil sensors, AI-based pest control, and advisory services can help. But the real challenge? Affordability and access.

My personal take: We need to respect and reignite the Green Revolution spirit, but with tech this time! Govt and private players must co-develop low-cost smart farming tools — solar-powered drip irrigation, AI soil scanners, weather alerts in regional languages, etc. If a farmer can't afford it, he won’t use it.

5. 120-Day Flyovers/Underpasses This one is fascinating. New infra technologies can cut project time drastically. Kant mentions quick-built underpasses that save lives and reduce traffic chaos.

My personal take: Let’s take it further — why not include smart traffic systems, reflective paint, solar-powered lights, and real-time pothole reporting apps? Road safety is STILL one of India's most neglected issues. A smart nation needs smart roads.

Some Thoughts From Me (Beyond the Article) As someone who has seen both rural India and the urban hustle, here are a few things I believe we urgently need to focus on:

Make Smart Agri Tech Truly Affordable Let’s be real — the average Indian farmer can't afford a ₹30,000 sensor kit. We need DIY kits, government subsidies, rural hackathons, and public research institutions to co-create tools with farmers, not just for them.

Smart Roads + Safety First Why do we still lose thousands to road accidents every year? Infra shouldn’t only be about speed — it should be about safety, sustainability, and accessibility. AI-driven traffic management, automatic emergency alerts, proper signage in rural areas — these should be part of every new project.

Green Energy Must Be Rural First We talk about EVs and solar rooftops, but villages are often left behind. Let’s create rural green energy zones, where solar, biogas, wind, and micro-hydro projects get fast-tracked and subsidized. Also, train local youth as green energy technicians — that’s employment + sustainability in one shot.

Mindset Shift > Tech Shift At the end of the day, innovation isn’t just tech — it’s mindset. We must celebrate people who solve real problems, not just build shiny apps. Encourage entrepreneurship in small towns. Make farmers, mechanics, masons — part of the tech revolution. I completely agree.

Let’s not just chase GDP numbers. Let’s build a country where clean water, safe roads, green energy, and smart tools reach every village, every home. We are still an agricultural driven country!

Benjamin Graham’s The Intelligent Investor remains the timeless manual for anyone who wants to build real wealth.

It doesn’t just teach what to invest in, it teaches how to think like an investor.


Some timeless lessons from the book 👇:

- Buy businesses, not tickers. Look at intrinsic value, not just market price.

- Margin of Safety. Always leave room for error - even the best investors are not always right.

- Mr. Market Analogy. The market is emotional - euphoric one day, depressed the next. Learn to take advantage, not follow blindly.

- Patience > Impulsiveness. True wealth is built over decades, not days.

- Circle of Competence. Stay within what you understand, depth beats breadth in investing.

- Continuous Learning. The market evolves, and so must your knowledge.


What I love most is how Graham connects investing with psychology. 

The real danger isn’t market volatility - it’s our own impatience, greed, and fear.

👉 If you can control your emotions, diversify wisely, and think long-term, you’re already ahead of most.

3943,38,"MF Secrets (Part 1): The Expense Ratio Trap

An explainer by CA Medha Arnal and Rudra Rai

When you invest in a mutual fund, the one cost you always check is the expense ratio.

But here’s the secret: in some funds, what you see is not what you actually pay.

👉 Example: Fund of Funds (FoFs).
These are funds that invest in other funds.
So there are two layers of costs:

1. The “wrapper” cost (FoF itself)
2. The cost of the underlying fund(s)

Most AMCs show you only the wrapper cost.
But the true cost = Wrapper + Weighted cost of the underlying.

⚠️ This can flip the ranking of cheapest vs. most expensive FoFs.

For instance, one gold FoF shows 0.1% TER… but once you add the underlying ETF cost, the real cost jumps to 0.83%!

So, what is an Expense Ratio anyway?

Think of it as the annual fee you pay the AMC to run the fund.

It covers:

* Fund manager’s salary 
* Research & analysts 
* Admin & marketing costs 

It’s shown as a % of your investment.
If a fund has a 1% expense ratio and you invest ₹1,00,000,
₹1,000 is charged annually (deducted inside the fund).

So lower expense ratio = more returns in your pocket.

⚡ Takeaway:
When it comes to FoFs, don’t stop at the “headline” expense ratio.
Always check if it includes the underlying cost.

Today’s economic and finance update captures India’s ambitious growth vision and its market resilience, even as foreign investment challenges continue. Here are the key highlights:

🌏 $30 Trillion Economy Vision: Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal announced that India will become a $30 trillion economy by 2047, up from the current $3.7 trillion. This bold target reflects strong confidence in India’s long-term growth trajectory despite external headwinds.

📈 Market Performance Momentum: Indian markets extended their winning streak for the second consecutive week, with Nifty50 gaining 1.5% (week ended Sept 12). All eyes are now on Sept 18–19, flagged as crucial dates with high momentum expected around key intraday clusters.

💸 Foreign Investment Outflows Continue: FIIs sold ₹11,169 crore worth of equities in the first half of September, taking total outflows in 2025 to ₹1,82,109 crore. Yet, DIIs remain the backbone, stepping in with sustained buying.

🛍 GST 2.0 Implementation: Ahead of the festive season, the government rolled out GST 2.0, reducing GST on spectacles & lenses to 5% along with other rate cuts. A timely move is expected to boost consumption.

📉 Inflation Outlook Improving: Economists cut inflation forecasts for FY26, with CRISIL projecting 3.2% (down from 3.5%). GST cuts + favorable base effects = easing price pressures.

📊 Growth Projections Robust: Despite global uncertainties, Deloitte maintains a 6.4–6.7% GDP growth forecast for FY26. Moody’s sees 6.3% in 2025, picking up to 6.5% in 2026.

💱 Currency & Forex Reserves: The rupee touched a record low of ₹88.44 per USD amid tariff worries and strong importer demand. On the bright side, forex reserves climbed to $698.27 billion (Sept 13), giving India a strong buffer.

🌐 Trade Policy Responses: To counter 50% US tariffs, the government is ready with mitigating measures from export incentives to sectoral support, ensuring minimal market share loss.

For the first time in 30 years, central banks worldwide now hold more gold than US Treasuries.
Yes, the same Treasuries that were once called the safest asset on earth.

A deep dive by CA Medha Arnal and Rudra Rai

---

What happened?

* Since 2022, central banks have gone on a gold-buying spree:
  → 1,082 tonnes in 2022
  → 1,037 tonnes in 2023
  → 1,180 tonnes in 2024 (record!)
* Total gold reserves = 36,344 tonnes (May 2025).
* Gold now makes up ~27% of reserves, trailing only the US dollar (46%).

Why this shift?

1. Dollar doubts → Rising US debt + political risk → “safe” Treasuries don’t feel as safe.
2. Systemic uncertainty → Geopolitics, wars, inflation → gold shines as the hedge.
3. Policy shift → For the first time in decades, central banks openly prefer gold over paper.

Even the UN says: “Uncertainty itself has become systemic.”

But wait…

* Buying has slowed in 2025 (166 tonnes in Q2 vs record highs before).
* Yet, 43% of central bankers still say they’ll increase gold reserves this year (World Gold Council survey).

Why it matters to you

When central banks change their playbook, it’s a signal.
Gold isn’t just jewellery or investment.
It’s the backup plan for entire nations.

P.S. This is not financial advice.

3766,38,"🍪 GST 2.0 → FMCG in focus

- A deep dive by CA Medha Arnal and Rudra Rai

What changed?

* Essentials like soaps, toothpaste, shampoo, biscuits → down to 5% GST.
* Indian breads, paneer, milk → now Nil GST.
* Earlier: many of these sat in the 12–18% bracket.

Why it matters?
FMCG = everyday consumption. Even a 5% cut here directly touches every household.
Analysts already calling HUL, Britannia, Dabur the big winners.

The tricky part:

* MRP confusion: Goods sold in ₹5 or ₹10 packs can’t just reduce price (imagine printing ₹4 MRP). Expect more grams in the same pack rather than lower MRP.
* Inventory issue: Retailers and distributors are sitting on inventory bought at higher GST. Retailers usually stock for 15-20 days ahead but nobody wants to stock more until new rates kick in (22 Sept). 
* Past lessons: In 2017, GST rollout froze FMCG sales for 2–3 weeks because of this same mismatch. This time, government + industry both claim they’re “better prepared.”
* Anti-profiteering clause: Section 171 says companies must pass benefits. Govt is already reminding FMCG firms - “lower tax must = lower price.”

---

Takeaway:
GST 2.0 is being sold as a “Diwali gift.” For FMCG, it might actually deliver.
But don’t be surprised if your first “benefit” looks like 10% extra chips instead of a ₹2 cheaper packet.

Mercedes just cut prices by up to ₹11 lakh.
S-Class down, GLS down, GLE down.
But here’s the weird part → GST on luxury cars went from 28% to 40%.

So how are cars cheaper?

An explainer by CA Medha Arnal and Rudra Rai

---

The Math Before GST 2.0
Luxury cars = 28% GST + 22% Compensation Cess = 50% effective tax.

The Math After GST 2.0
Compensation Cess scrapped → folded into a flat 40% “special rate.”
Net effect = 50% → 40%.
That’s why prices will fall.

What was this Compensation Cess anyway?
Back in 2017, when GST launched, states worried they’d lose revenue.
Centre promised to “compensate” them for 5 years.
To fund that, they taxed “sin + luxury” goods extra: cars, tobacco, aerated drinks.

Problem? The promise lasted longer than 5 years because the Centre borrowed against cess collections. Those loans + interest are still being repaid.

So what’s changing now?

* For most luxury goods → cess merged into 40% GST from 22 Sept 2025.
* For tobacco products → cess continues at existing rate for now and new rates will be notified at a later date.

Takeaway:
Middle class gets relief on bikes + ACs.
The rich save lakhs on Mercs.
And GST takes one more step toward simplification.

👉 Thursday = expiry day.

Not anymore.
From September 1, all NSE F&O contracts now expire on Tuesdays.

That means:

* Monday + Tuesday will be the most volatile sessions ⚡
* Friday-to-Monday time decay just got sharper
* Strategies need a total re-think
* And yes, BSE still keeps Thursdays - so expiry plays may now split across exchanges

Think about it:

Curated by CA Medha Arnal and Rudra Rai

Everyone was expecting India’s economy to slow down.
But surprise, surprise - 7.8% growth in Q1! 🌟
The highest since Q4 FY2024.

So what’s really driving this?
It’s not all magic:

* Government spending hit a high (₹2.8L crore), 52% higher than the same period last year.
* Exports surged - especially to the US before those 50% tariffs hit.
* The services sector stayed strong, keeping things steady.
* Rural demand rose, powered by a great monsoon and healthy agriculture.
* Oh, and low inflation helped too - making sure the growth was real.

Now, are we seeing a real boom or is it a temporary bounce? 🤔
India’s still the fastest-growing major economy - but most experts believe the effects of the tariffs and lower private-sector capex will be felt sharply by the economy in the ongoing quarters.

3181,38,"The Hidden World of Promoter Pledging

Ever read a headline like “Promoters pledge 70% of shares” and wondered - what does that even mean?

An explainer by CA Medha Arnal and Rudra Rai

What does pledging mean?

Promoters often need money - for expansion, debt repayment, or even personal reasons.
Instead of selling their stake, they pledge shares as collateral to raise loans from banks/NBFCs.

Think of it like a mortgage.
The shares are the house.
The bank is the lender.

Why is it risky for investors?

If the stock price falls, the value of pledged shares also falls.
Banks then issue a margin call → promoters must top up cash/shares.
If they can’t, the bank can sell those shares in the open market.

Result?
Stock price crashes.
Retail investors take the hit.

Has this ever happened?

1. Zee Entertainment (2019)
Promoter pledging shot up above 90%.
When lenders invoked the pledge, the stock tanked over 20% in a week.

2. Yes Bank (2018–19)
Promoter Rana Kapoor pledged shares heavily.
As the stock collapsed, lenders offloaded shares, accelerating the crash.
Retail investors were wiped out.

Is pledging always bad?

Not necessarily.

Pledging is simply a form of leverage.
If a company is fundamentally strong, generating steady cash flows, and using pledged shares to fund growth → it can be a smart move.

But…
If pledging is high and fundamentals are shaky, it’s a red flag.
Because one slip in earnings can trigger a chain reaction of margin calls and forced selling.

3179,38,"The US national debt shooting past $37 trillion, way ahead of forecasts, is all over the news.

But who actually lends all this money to the US government?

An explainer by CA Medha Arnal and Rudra Rai

---

What is US Debt?

Debt is just the total money the US government owes its lenders.
Right now:

* $37 trillion+ total debt
* That’s 122% of GDP (basically, America owes more than it makes in a year)
* The debt grows by $1 trillion every 3 months

Who Lends to the US?

When the US government needs cash, it borrows by selling Treasury Bills, Notes, and Bonds (IOUs with interest).

The surprise? Most of US debt (~75%) is owed to Americans themselves, not foreign countries.

What is the Debt Ceiling and why does it Keep Rising?

Congress sets a limit on how much the US can borrow → the “debt ceiling.”
But since spending keeps outpacing tax revenue, the ceiling has been raised 78 times since 1960.

Example: On July 4, 2025, President Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), adding $5 trillion to the borrowing limit to avoid a government default.

Why Does This Matter?

* Credit Rating: Moody’s recently downgraded US credit because of the rising debt load.
* Interest Payments: The US already spends hundreds of billions every year just to pay interest - money that can’t go to healthcare, education, or defense.
* Global Risks: Countries like China and Japan have indicated their intention to use Treasury holdings as leverage in recent trade talks.

Key Takeaway

The US owes more than ever, but most of it is homegrown debt. The real risk isn’t foreign lenders pulling out - it’s whether America can keep financing its own lifestyle without crippling its future.",FALSE,"Aug. 24, 2025, 12:31 a.m.","Aug. 30, 2025, 12:09 p.m.","Memes,Money,News","378,334,14,13,62,42,7,38,19,49,3,37,20,27,8",0,0,24

A full-blown search and seizure was underway.

Why?
SEBI is investigating if some trading academies are blending “education” with penny stock manipulation - using classrooms to pump prices.

But aren’t some of these games based on skill, not gambling?
Yes - courts have long said games like rummy and fantasy cricket involve substantial skill.

→ That’s why Dream11 argued it’s not gambling.
→ But this Bill ignores the distinction and bans all money games together.

Later this year, in a GST case, the Supreme Court will decide whether fantasy sports and rummy count as gambling. Its verdict could also decide if startups owe ₹1.5 trillion ($20B) in back taxes.

What about esports or non-money games?
The Bill actually supports esports (treated as a legitimate sport) and educational/social games (like quiz apps or cultural games).

→ Esports will get official recognition, training academies, and events.
→ Safe, kid-friendly social games will be promoted.

So the investors must be upset?
Backers like Tiger Global, Kalaari, Peak XV, DST Global put billions into India’s gaming sector.
They argue:

→ Policy flip-flops hurt Ease of Doing Business.
→ A blanket ban could push players to shady offshore apps.
→ Regulation (age checks, spending limits) would be safer than prohibition.

So, what’s next?
Rajya Sabha still needs to clear the Bill. Investors are not writing off their investments just yet, and still hope the government may agree to make some changes before the bill becomes law.

→ In short: India’s gaming industry is at a crossroads.
→ If the ban holds, Dream11, MPL, Zupee, RummyCircle and others could vanish overnight.
→ If regulation replaces prohibition, the sector could rebound - but investors are on edge.

A deep dive by CA Medha Arnal and Rudra Rai

This one’s a little long but worth the read (we’re both lawyers after all).

What just happened?
The Lok Sabha passed the Promotion & Regulation of Online Gaming Bill, 2025. It bans all online money games - whether they are based on skill (like fantasy cricket on Dream11) or chance (like online rummy).

Which games are banned?
Any app where you pay to play and win money is banned.
Examples:
→ Dream11, My11Circle (fantasy cricket/football)
→ RummyCulture, RummyCircle (online rummy)
→ Pool Champs, Online Carrom (casual games with entry fees)

Even advertising these apps or processing payments for them is illegal.

Who gets hit hardest?
The real-money gaming market was the biggest chunk of India’s gaming industry, generating about $2.4B revenue in FY24 alone.

→ Dream11, Gameskraft, Games24x7 alone earned ~$1.36B last year.
→ Global investors had pumped in $2.8B over five years.

Companies like Dream11 and Mobile Premier League (MPL) were even preparing for IPOs. Those plans are now at risk.

3102,38,"The Circle of Valuations

A deep dive by CA Medha Arnal and Rudra Rai

Ever wondered what Large Cap, Mid Cap, and Small Cap actually mean?
It’s all about market capitalization rankings:

* Large Cap → Top 100 companies (1st–100th by market cap)
* Mid Cap → Next 150 companies (101st–250th)
* Small Cap → From 251st company onwards

---

Why this matters

Risk vs. Stability
Large caps are like the blue-chip giants - stable, liquid, and less volatile. Mid and small caps are riskier, but often grow faster when the economy is expanding.

Valuation Signals
P/E multiples (price-to-earnings) of these groups show what investors are paying for every rupee of earnings.

* If small and midcaps are trading at much higher multiples than large caps, it signals high growth expectations (but also risk of bubbles).
* If large caps look expensive, it may mean the market is chasing safety.

Mutual Fund Rules
SEBI regulations require funds to invest defined portions into large, mid, and small caps. So these categories are not just theory - they directly shape investment flows.

Understanding these divisions helps investors judge where the froth is - and where long-term opportunities might lie.

India has advanced its ethanol blending targets to cut oil import dependency, support farmers, and lower transport emissions.

E20 (20% ethanol–petrol blend) rollout began in 2023 across select pumps; manufacturers introduced E20-compatible vehicles. Policy momentum continues alongside parallel EV push.

🎯 Objectives of Ethanol Blending
Reduce crude oil imports and strengthen energy security.

Provide remunerative demand for sugarcane and alternative feedstocks (damaged grains, surplus rice via FCI policy windows, maize).

Lower lifecycle GHG emissions and tailpipe pollutants from the transport sector.

Stimulate rural income, biorefineries, and circular bioeconomy.

📈 Progress So Far
Achieved 10% blending (E10) ahead of schedule; phased rollout of E20 in urban clusters since 2023.

OEMs provide E20-compatible models; E20/E85-flex fuel pilots in select cities.

Expanded distillation capacity through grain- and molasses-based units; enabling policies include interest subvention, differential pricing, and long-term offtake.

🚗 Consumer Response and Vehicle Issues
New vehicles labeled “E20-ready”; older vehicles can typically use up to E10 safely—higher blends may raise concerns:

Potential mileage drop (lower energy density of ethanol vs petrol).

Material compatibility for fuel lines, seals, and injectors in non-E20-ready vehicles.

Cold starts and vapor lock risk in specific climates if not tuned.

Calls to allow consumer choice at pumps (E0/E10/E20) to manage transition and maintenance apprehensions.

🌿 Environmental Balance Sheet
Positives:

Lower CO and HC emissions; potential CO2 reductions when considering well-to-wheel, especially with 2G (residue-based) ethanol.

Supports crop residue valorization if advanced biofuels scale up.

Concerns:

Sugarcane is water-intensive; regional water stress and groundwater depletion risks.

Monocropping and fertilizer use may offset some climate gains.

Land-use shifts for grain-based ethanol must safeguard food security; sustainability hinges on feedstock mix and yield improvements.

👨🌾 Farm Economics and Food–Fuel Trade-offs
Sugarcane arrears can reduce when mills have a steady ethanol outlet; price stability helps farmers.

Risk flags:

Over-reliance on cane in water-scarce regions.

Diverting grains during tight harvests can pressure food prices; policy must be counter-cyclical (use damaged/surplus stocks, set grain caps, prioritize maize productivity).

Policy cushion: diversify feedstocks (maize, sweet sorghum, damaged grains, molasses, agri-residues) and ramp 2G ethanol.

🏭 Supply Capacity and Logistics
Distillery capacity expanded with financial incentives; grain-based capacities growing faster.

Logistics needs:

Dedicated E20 dispensing, blending terminals, quality control.

Storage and distribution planning to avoid regional shortages.

Blending economics sensitive to cane prices, sugar realization, grain MSPs, and crude price cycles.

🌍 International Angle
India’s ethanol boom intersects with global food inflation debates. Trade/device standards and potential export/import restrictions can influence domestic pricing.

Benchmark policies (Brazil flex-fuel, US corn ethanol) offer lessons: vehicle compatibility, emission accounting, and water–land safeguards are key.

🔀 Ethanol vs EV Transition: Complement or Compete?
Short–medium term: Ethanol blending decarbonizes the large ICE fleet quickly.

Long term: EVs offer deeper decarbonization with clean grids. Biofuels can complement for hard-to-electrify segments and legacy vehicles.

Policy coherence:

Avoid lock-in: keep ethanol targets flexible with periodic reviews.

Align with battery manufacturing, charging infra, and RE share growth.

Encourage flex-fuel hybrids and ethanol-ready two-wheelers as bridging options.

⚖️ Key Challenges
Water footprint and regional ecological limits for sugarcane.

Food price sensitivity if grain diversion is excessive during poor harvests.

Engine compatibility for older ICE vehicles; consumer communication and warranties.

Ensuring robust MRV (measurement, reporting, verification) for lifecycle GHG accounting.

Stable pricing formula for ethanol to keep mills solvent without burdening consumers.

🧭 Way Forward (Actionable)
Diversify feedstocks and scale 2G/advanced ethanol using crop residues and municipal organic waste.

Regional crop planning: push cane in agro-ecologically suitable, irrigated-efficiency zones; promote micro-irrigation.

Strengthen maize productivity and storage to de-risk grain-based ethanol.

Ensure multi-grade availability at pumps (E0/E10/E20) during transition; clear labeling and OEM guidance.

Tighten sustainability criteria: water budgeting, biodiversity safeguards, and social impact monitoring.

Integrate with urban air quality goals; combine with BS-VI calibration improvements and inspection–maintenance regimes.

📝 Prelims Quick Hits
E10 = 10% ethanol + 90% petrol; E20 = 20% ethanol + 80% petrol.

Feedstocks: C-/B-heavy molasses, direct cane juice (capped), damaged/surplus grains, maize; 2G from agri-residues.

Ethanol has lower calorific value than petrol → marginal mileage drop expected.

Brazil and US are the global leaders; India is among the fastest-growing ethanol markets.

💡 Mains Answer Frame (GS3: Economy/Environment)
Intro: Ethanol blending as a pragmatic, near-term decarbonization and energy security lever.

Benefits: import substitution, farmer income, rural industry, air quality.

Risks: water use, food–fuel trade-offs, lifecycle emissions uncertainty, engine compatibility.

Assessment: compare E20 with EV pathway; insist on sustainability criteria and diversified feedstocks.

Conclusion: Balanced portfolio—scale advanced biofuels, protect food and water security, and accelerate EV infra for long-run net-zero.

✅ One-liners for Revision
Ethanol is a bridge solution for ICE decarbonization; EVs remain the endgame with a cleaner grid.

Sustainability rests on feedstock diversity and regional water prudence.

Growth Story
India has been the fastest-growing major economy.

* GDP grew 8.8% on avg between FY22–FY24
* Growth of 6.8% a year expected over the next 3 years.

---

Fiscal Discipline

* Fiscal deficit at 4.8% of GDP in FY25, targeted at 4.4% in FY26.
* Combined centre + states deficit projected to fall to 6.6% by FY29.

An explainer by CA Medha Arnal and Rudra Rai

It’s India’s flagship program to boost manufacturing through production -linked incentives. That means, the more you make in India, the more rewards you get.

When was it launched?

2020

How much has the government spent so far?

~₹1.97 lakh crore (over US$26 billion)

Which sectors can benefit?

14 critical sectors - the ones with maximum budget allocation in the current year include electronics manufacturing and IT hardware, Automobiles and Auto Components, Pharmaceuticals, Textile, White Goods (ACs and LED Lights), and Specialty Steel.

But what is the purpose of the scheme?

The PLI scheme is aimed at attracting investment in high-tech industries, boosting domestic manufacturing, reducing import dependence, and integrating India into global supply chains.

So is the purpose being achieved?

As of August 2024, actual investments totalling ₹1.46 lakh crore have been realised leading to:
- Boost in production and sales, amounting to ₹12.50 lakh crore
- Employment generation with 9.5 lakh jobs created
- ⁠Boost to exports which have crossed Rs. 4 lakh crores

Analysts say GDP could take a 0.3-0.6% hit if penalties stick.
Piyush Goyal calls it a “chance to find opportunity in crisis.”

MSMEs Face Tariff Turbulence

US tariffs could slash Indian MSME exports to America by up to 50%, risking ~$30B in annual business. 
With 45% of India’s outbound shipments coming from MSMEs, industry bodies urge urgent diversification into untapped ~$60B markets like Africa, Latin America, and Eastern Europe.

Some exports are rerouting via UAE, but the sector fears a ~$3 billion hit to workers.

- A deep dive by CA Medha Arnal and Rudra Rai

REIT = Real Estate Investment Trust
Think of it like a mutual fund, but for property.

Instead of buying an apartment or office, you buy units in a REIT.
Those units give you a share of rental income and property appreciation.

⸻

What’s inside a REIT?
A REIT owns income-generating real estate 
Like office parks, malls, warehouses, data centres, hotels.

In India, most listed REITs hold commercial office spaces rented to MNCs, tech parks, banks, etc.

⸻

How it works
	•	You invest in the REIT (like buying a stock)
	•	The REIT collects rent from tenants
	•	After costs, it pays out most of that rent to you as dividends

In India, REITs must distribute 90% of net income to investors.

⸻

Structure of a REIT

There are 4 key players:
	1.	Sponsor – Sets up the REIT (e.g., Blackstone in Knowledge Realty’s case)
	2.	REIT Trust – Owns the assets
	3.	Manager – Runs operations, leasing, and strategy
	4.	Trustee – Safeguards investors’ interests

⸻

How do REITs make money?
	1.	Rentals from tenants
	2.	Capital appreciation from rising property values
	3.	New acquisitions that increase rental income

You make money via:
→ Dividend payouts (regular income)
→ Price gains (if REIT unit value goes up)

⸻

India’s REIT Market

India currently has 4 listed REITs. It’s still a nascent market, with REITs accounting for only about 14% of total listed real estate in India. For context, in mature markets like the USA over 99% of realty market cap is accounted for by REITs.

⸻

In short:
REITs let you invest in property without dealing with tenants, brokers, or paintwork.

As you can see in the screenshot, under Expenses & Commissions, it shows: • Expenses Paid: ₹48.7K • Commissions (if any): ₹0

I always thought that direct plans had lower expense ratios and no commissions (which is true here), but nearly ₹50K in expenses over ~4 years feels really high especially when my net gain is about ₹3.8–4L.

I understand that mutual funds charge ongoing expenses through the NAV, but seeing it visualized like this makes me feel like a big chunk of my returns have quietly gone away.

Why?
Isn’t “cost cutting” supposed to cheer investors?

Not this time.

Because this isn’t just a layoff.
It’s a business model shock.

For 30 years, Indian IT scaled by adding headcount.
Now, three forces are breaking that model:

1. AI.
AI writes boilerplate code in seconds.
Fewer entry-level coders needed.
Mid-levels get pushed to “PIP zones.”
Automation is eating repetitive work.

2. GCCs (Global Capability Centres).
Foreign clients are building their own teams in India.
Instead of paying TCS, Infosys, or Wipro,
they set up GCCs and hire Indian talent directly.
48% plan to expand headcount in FY26.

3. U.S. headwinds & cost pressures.
The U.S. is still the biggest market for Indian IT.
Slower tech spending, delayed projects, and cautious CIOs
mean every dollar is under review.
Clients want cheaper + faster - or they cut deals entirely.

A cheaper workforce doesn’t help…
If the entire billing model breaks.

This isn’t a slowdown.
It’s a reset.

India’s biggest salary engine is evolving.
And we’re all watching it live.

— A deep dive by CA Medha Arnal and Rudra Rai

Every time you buy a stock, it gets stored in a demat account - like a locker for your shares.

But who runs these lockers?

That’s where depositories come in.
In India, we only have two: NSDL and CDSL.

Both act as the infrastructure layer for our stock market - they keep your shares safe, settle trades, and maintain ownership records.

So what’s happening now?

India’s older and larger depository - NSDL - just launched an IPO.

Most people know CDSL (because it’s listed). But NSDL?
Turns out, it holds more value, even if it has fewer accounts.

→ NSDL is where the big boys park their shares.
→ CDSL is where all of us open accounts with Zerodha, Groww, etc.

NSDL’s IPO is a big deal because depositories are like digital infrastructure for the markets. They don’t lend, take positions, or give stock tips. They just run the rails.

But how each depository earns - and scales - is a whole other story.
And that’s where the numbers get interesting.

2801,38,"Why does the FMCG sector care about the rain forecast?

- An explainer by CA Medha Arnal and Rudra Rai

Simple.
A good monsoon → better agri output → more cash in rural pockets → higher demand for daily essentials.

Rural India drives 35–40% of FMCG sales - but in categories like soaps, shampoos, food staples, that share is often higher.

When farm incomes rise, rural households buy more:
✔️ Packaged foods
✔️ Home & personal care products
✔️ Basic health & hygiene goods

---

That’s why FMCG CEOs - like at HUL’s recent AGM - talk about rainfall almost as much as revenue.

The monsoon isn’t just a weather event. For companies, it’s demand.

- A quick breakdown by CA Medha Arnal & Rudra Rai

Shares of Indian Energy Exchange (IEX) crashed over 30% in a single day this week.
The reason? A big regulatory shift called market coupling.

But first - what does IEX do?

IEX runs India’s largest power trading platform.

Power trading is how electricity gets bought and sold - not by households, but between generators (like NTPC, Tata Power) and bulk buyers (like state distribution companies (discoms), big industries, etc.).

They don’t always have long-term contracts. So they use power exchanges - like IEX - to buy electricity for the next day (Day-Ahead Market) or even the next hour (Real-Time Market), just like you’d buy or sell stocks.

These trades help balance demand or supply gaps, set fair prices and improve efficiency in the grid.

IEX has long been the leader in this space - until now.
Because with market coupling, the game is about to change.

Now, the new market coupling rule will centralise price discovery across all exchanges.
So instead of IEX setting prices independently, all bids and offers will be pooled - and one uniform price will be set for everyone.

This hurts IEX in two ways:
– It loses pricing power
– It risks losing trading volumes to other platforms

Think of it like this: IEX goes from being the price-maker… to just another facilitator.

This isn’t a one-day fall. It’s a change in the rules of the game.
And the market is treating it that way.

P.S. This is not a stock recommendation.

- A deep dive by CA Medha Arnal and Rudra Rai

In the first half of 2025, 26 companies raised over ₹52,200 crore through IPOs - led by HDB Financial’s ₹12,500 crore issue.

That’s already one-third of the total raised in all of 2024 (₹1.6 lakh crore from 90 IPOs).

But the real wave is yet to come:

- ₹2.58 lakh crore in IPOs are lined up
- ₹1.15 lakh crore already cleared by SEBI
- Another ₹1.43 lakh crore awaiting approval

Mutual funds are stepping up.
With high secondary market valuations, MFs are turning to IPOs for better value.

Meanwhile, private equity firms are heading for the exit - with IPOs becoming the preferred route for big-ticket exits across consumer tech and fintech.

PhonePe, Meesho, Pine Labs, Groww, Tata Capital - the queue is packed.

I just checked my latest portfolio health, and here’s a detailed breakdown of the insights:

• Overall Portfolio Score: 87/100
This strong score indicates my investments are performing very well on all key fronts.

Component Scores:

1. Quality Score: 100/100, Every stock in my portfolio has exceptionally strong fundamentals—none are flagged as low quality. This means I’ve focused on companies with reliable financials, stability, and solid growth prospects.

2. Momentum Score: 80/100, A high momentum score reflects that most of my stocks are currently experiencing positive market trends, indicating good recent and ongoing performance.

3. Diversification Score: 70/100, My holdings are reasonably diversified, helping reduce risk. There's some room to further spread out investments across different sectors or asset classes, but the current spread already supports portfolio stability.

What does this mean?

1. A high overall score backed by perfect quality and strong momentum signals a healthy, growth-oriented portfolio.

2. Solid diversification provides a safety net while allowing for adjustment opportunities to optimize risk and return.

3. There are no low-quality stocks found—this underlines a disciplined, fundamentals-driven investing approach.

My wife recently applied for a PF claim under the House Construction category, but it got rejected with the message:
""Claim Rejected: EPS CONTRIBUTIONS NOT RECEIVED FOR EPS MEMBER. CONTACT ER AND CLARIFY.""

Here’s some background:

She joined her first company in May 2017 with a salary below ₹15,000, so we believe she was automatically enrolled into EPS (Employee Pension Scheme).

She worked there until Jan 2021, during which time the company was acquired. So in her PF passbook, there are two entries (under different IDs) for the same duration.

Since then, she has worked in three more companies, including her current one.

On checking her PF passbook, we noticed that from the second company onward, EPS contribution is consistently zero—the entire amount is going only into EPF.

All her PF has been successfully transferred to the current organization. The previous companies’ member ID balances show zero.

She has also made a couple of illness-related claims in the past, and those were processed without any issues.

Now, with the house construction claim being rejected, we’re wondering if the missing EPS contributions starting second company are causing this.

Would really appreciate help on the following:

Why did EPS contributions stop after her first job?

Does this need to be corrected now? If yes, how can we go about it?

Is there any way she can proceed with the House Construction claim under the current situation?

The Eternal story everyone is missing

- A deep dive by CA Medha Arnal and Rudra Rai

Eternal’s Q1 profits fell 90%. The stock rose 7%.

Here’s why that’s not crazy:

→ Quick commerce just became the main act.
For the first time, Blinkit overtook food delivery - ₹2,400+ crore in quarterly revenue.

→ They’re building aggressively.
243 new stores opened in 90 days. Short-term pain, long-term moat.

→ Margins are quietly improving.
Some cities hit 2.5%+. They're targeting 5–6%, and shifting to a inventory ownership model for Blinkit.

→ Food delivery was hit by seasonality.
Festivals + rain = fewer orders. Costs rose. Margins dipped slightly to 5%.

→ New bets are still early.
10-min food & ticketing burn is up, but management indicates they’re doing well.

So yes, profit fell.
But revenue surged 67%.
And the business mix is changing fast.

The market isn’t reacting to the numbers.
It’s reacting to the direction.

And Blinkit isn’t a side bet anymore. It’s the headline.

No one talks about this.

A personal finance explainer curated by CA Medha Arnal and Rudra Rai

This is what household debt in India looks like now - and it’s growing fast.

But the real question is:
How much of your own income goes to EMIs?

That number is your debt-to-income ratio (DTI).
Most people ignore it. Every lender watches it.

---

DTI = (Total EMIs ÷ Monthly Income) × 100

Earn ₹1L/month, pay ₹30k in EMIs → DTI = 30%

---

Here’s how banks see it:

< 20% → Excellent
20–35% → Good
36–40% → Fair
> 40% → High risk

Most lenders cut you off after 40-43%.
Even with a good credit score.

---

Why it matters now:

– BNPL, UPI EMIs, credit cards = booming
– Household debt is 42% of GDP
– Salaries aren’t keeping pace

---

High DTI = less room for emergencies
And harder to get new loans when you need them most.

2523,38,"India and the US are closing in on a mini trade deal 

But one issue keeps stalling progress

Agriculture.

Inside the India-US Trade Impasse

- A deep dive by CA Medha Arnal and Rudra Rai

Dairy: More Than Just Trade

The US wants India to open its dairy market. But India insists that imported milk must come from cows not fed animal-based products like meat or blood.

For India, it’s not just trade - it’s religious, cultural, and deeply emotional.

US officials call it a ”non-tariff barrier.""
India calls it a non-negotiable red line.

What’s at Stake?

- India is the world’s largest milk producer providing employment to over 8 crore individuals
- A 15% drop in prices could cost them ₹1.03 lakh crore/year (SBI estimate)
- India currently has 30–60% tariffs on dairy to shield local producers from subsidized US imports

GM Crops: The Backdoor Risk

The US is also pushing for India to accept GM soy and corn, even as animal feed.

But India fears this is a backdoor for GM seeds - tying farmers to patented inputs and breaking traditional seed sovereignty.

In a country where 85% of farmers are smallholders, seed control = survival.

Where Talks Stand Now

A mini deal may include:

- Limited access to non-sensitive agri products
- Concessions in non-GM, non-dairy areas
- Possibly no mention of GMOs at all (as India holds firm)

This isn’t just a tariff fight. It’s a battle over values, livelihoods, and long-term control.

🚀 The latest financial policy rollout by the White House—Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBBA)—aims to reshape the financial future of millions of Americans.

So, I created this clean, data-backed presentation to simplify the numbers and highlight the real impact—from wage increases to tax benefits and housing development.

💡 What’s Inside the Deck?
📌 Real-wage increases across all 50 states (inflation-adjusted take-home pay 📈)
📌 Projected increase in real take-home pay for families 💵
📌 How 88% of American seniors will now benefit from no tax on Social Security 👵👴
📌 New housing units in Opportunity Zones, fueling growth in underserved areas 🏘️

🗺️ Example Highlights from Key States:
🔹 California: Up to $8,800 wage gain | 6M seniors benefit | 37,000 housing units
🔹 Texas: 4M seniors benefit | 20,000 housing units
🔹 Florida & New York: Massive boosts in income and housing

📈 Also included:
A chart showcasing the Top 5 states leading in real-wage increases—see where your state stands.

⚖️ But there’s a deeper conversation here—who really benefits?
While the bill promises middle-class relief, experts warn that capital-heavy investors and corporations might be the primary winners.

💬 Let’s discuss: Do you believe OBBBA delivers real relief to working Americans? Or is it a top-heavy policy with hidden consequences?

— Curated by CA Medha Arnal and Rudra Rai

A new HSBC survey of affluent Indians (with $100K–$2M in investable assets) reveals a clear shift in how they’re allocating money.
(Over 1,000 Indian investors were surveyed.)

Cash is no longer king
Cash holdings dropped 10 percentage points from 2024. Just 15% now sits idle.

Gold is glittering again
Allocation to gold jumped 7% - the biggest rise across all assets. Likely a hedge for uncertainty.

Alternatives are rising
Private equity, hedge funds, REITs and crypto - alternatives now make up 23%+ of portfolios. The rich are hunting yield beyond equity-debt.

What matters most to them?
→ Investing in property (41%)
→ Supporting family financially (41%)

And how much for a comfortable retirement?
→ Average number quoted: $401,000
That’s around ₹3.35 crore

So are rate cuts coming next?

Curated by CA Medha Arnal & Rudra Rai

Maybe. But it’s not that simple.

June’s inflation came in at 2.1% - but mostly because food prices dropped.

Meanwhile, health, education, and housing costs are still rising.

This is why RBI looks beyond the headline - they monitor what’s driving inflation, not just the number.

And it’s not just inflation - growth matters too.

RBI Governor Malhotra summed it up:

“If inflation is lower and the forecast is lower, or if growth is lower, policy rates can be cut.”

---

Why does falling inflation lead to lower interest rates?

Most of you got it right in our quiz, so here’s the breakdown we promised.

Simple:
→ When inflation is high, central banks raise rates to slow spending.
→ When inflation drops, they may cut rates to make borrowing cheaper and boost demand.

But only if it’s safe to do so - i.e., inflation is expected to stay low, and growth needs support.

Inflation down? Good.
Core inflation? Still sticky.
Growth? Still uncertain.

Tesla just launched the Model Y in India at ₹61 lakh.

Because it’s coming in as a CBU:
→ Fully built overseas
→ 110% import duty slapped on it

* SKD (Semi Knocked-Down) = moderate tax
* CKD (Completely Knocked-Down) = lowest tax

I started a ₹1,000 SIP in ICICI Prudential Large Cap Fund - Regular Plan back in Nov 2011. Ran it for 12 years and then let it stay idle. Today, it has grown from ₹1.43L invested to ₹5.03L — which sounds great, right?

But take a look at this breakdown (screenshot attached): • Fund Expenses paid: ₹98.4K • Commissions (distributor cut): ₹98.4K

That’s ₹1.96L in costs, nearly 40% of my total gains. And the broker commission was silently eating away returns every year.

This was never made obvious when I started. I thought sticking with a Regular Plan and staying invested long-term was enough. Turns out, I was unknowingly feeding a distributor all these years without getting any real advice or service in return.

If you’re still investing in Regular Plans, consider switching to Direct Plans. Same fund, same performance — but you get to keep the commission for yourself. Over 10–15 years, the difference can be huge.

Honest Review After 20 Days of Usage Note: Due to a delivery mess-up, I was awarded twice the cashback percentage this month as an apology—please keep that in mind while reading.

In the past 20 days, I’ve received a total cashback of ₹2009.13—of which ₹1852.00 (doubled) came from Entertainment and Sports, and ₹157.13 (doubled) came from Groceries.

Pros:
Lifetime Free Card – No annual or renewal fees.

Generous Interest-Free Period – Offers a 62-day interest-free period, plus an additional 3-day grace period.

Custom Cashback Categories – On the 1st of each month, you can choose 2 out of 6 categories for cashback.

Genuine 20% Cashback – The 20% cashback for Entertainment and Sports is real (Note: Movies are a separate category that also gets 20%).

Minimalist & Thoughtful Packaging – The card comes in sleek packaging, and you even get a set of stickers.

Clean App Interface – The application’s interface is visually appealing and user-friendly, barring a few bugs.

Instant Transaction Categorization – Purchases are reflected instantly with accurate categories. Pro Tip: Turn off “Online Spends,” make a purchase, and check which category the merchant falls into.

Cons:
Security Issues in the App – The app can occasionally be accessed without PIN or fingerprint if notifications are disabled. When the permission screen appears, hitting “Back” sometimes grants access without verification.

Incomplete UPI Functionality – The card is visible in UPI apps and linkable, but you can’t set a PIN or actually use UPI—this includes Unity Bank.

Card Storage Glitches – Saving the card on platforms (Google Play and JioMart, in my case.) often leads to failed transactions or card being declined. You’ll need to re-add the card each time to proceed with transaction with this card.

Merchant Misclassification –

Steam transactions using ""Debit Card (Domestic)"" is misclassified as Groceries (2% cashback), instead of Entertainment (20%).

Steam transactions using ""Credit Card (Domestic)"" fails in Steam itself without reaching OTP Screen.

Steam transactions using ""Prepaid Wallet (Domestic)"" is counted as Rent.

Neutral Points (May Vary Based on Usage):
Linked Savings Account – You’re required to open a Unity Small Finance Bank savings account to get this card.

Withdrawals below the savings balance are treated as debit transactions (no fee).

Withdrawals above the balance are treated as credit card transactions (fee applies).

Cashback Conditions – Cashback is capped at ₹2500/month. Redemption is allowed once you accumulate at least ₹250.

Dual-Nature Card – The card functions as both credit and debit. If you exceed your credit limit, the excess amount is debited from your linked savings account—helpful for over-limit purchases without over-limit fees unlike competitors.",TRUE,"July 1, 2025, 9:21 a.m.","July 2, 2025, 3:29 p.m.",,"4,6,2,7,3,5",5,0,6

In 1980, the price of 24-carat gold in India was around ₹1,330 per 10 grams. Fast forward to 2025, and it’s crossed ₹1,00,000.

That’s a 75x increase in 45 years.

Year-by-Year Glimpse:

Here’s a quick timeline I jotted down: • 1980 – ₹1,330 • 1990 – ₹3,200 • 2000 – ₹4,400 • 2010 – ₹18,500 • 2020 – ₹47,562 • 2024 – ₹77,000 • 2025 (June) – ₹98,961

Just this year, in 2025, it’s gone from ₹78K in Jan to ₹1 lakh+ by June in some cities like Kolkata. Crazy.

Why the rise? Some key reasons behind this price surge: • Inflation and weakening of the rupee • Central banks (especially in Asia) stacking up gold reserves • Global uncertainty (war, recession, debt fears—you name it) • India’s undying love for gold, especially during weddings and festivals

Also, let’s not forget gold is still largely tax-free when inherited or gifted, making it a generational asset for many families.

So what’s the takeaway? • If your parents or grandparents bought gold in the 80s or 90s, they made a hell of an investment. • Even though new-age investors chase stocks, crypto, and mutual funds, gold has proven time and again that it holds value—especially when things go south.

It’s not about “buy gold now and get rich tomorrow.” It’s more like: buy gold and stay rich for decades.

According to sources cited by PTI, the company has engaged four prominent global investment banks—Kotak Mahindra Capital, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Morgan Stanley—to advise on and underwrite the offering.

Currently valued at approximately $12 billion, PhonePe is reportedly aiming to raise $1.5 billion through the IPO, a capital influx that could elevate its valuation to around $15 billion. The proposed listing marks a significant milestone not only for the company but also for India’s broader digital economy, which has seen rapid expansion on the back of the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) framework.

The company is expected to file its Draft Red Herring Prospectus (DRHP) with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) by August, with the public listing anticipated before the close of the calendar year.

To my surprise, my application got rejected with the reason: “You already hold an HDFC card, so a second cannot be issued.” This sounded off to me. I knew from personal experience that it’s possible to hold more than one.

I wasn’t satisfied with the reason, so I raised a complaint with HDFC’s Grievance Redressal and Priority Support teams. Their reply? A vague “You are not eligible as per internal assessment.” I asked again for the specific reason especially since, as per RBI mandates, customers are entitled to proper disclosure. Still got the same vague response.

All this happened before mid-April.

In May, I followed up again via email,same generic reply. Frustrated, I finally raised a complaint with the RBI Ombudsman on 31st May.

On 5th June, I got a call from HDFC saying they were now processing my application, and if approved, the credit limit would be shared with my existing card. I was totally fine with that, I don’t use the limit on my Core card much anyway.

The card was approved on 9th June and delivered on the 16th.

Now, honestly, I wasn’t desperate for this card. But if they had just given me a clear and fair reason for the rejection in the first place, I would have moved on. It was their vague and dismissive replies that triggered me to escalate the matter further.

So, If you’re getting vague or unjustified responses from your bank, don’t hesitate to take it up with the RBI Ombudsman.",TRUE,"June 18, 2025, 11:57 a.m.","June 25, 2025, 7:10 p.m.",,"2,62,3",7,0,3
1961,56,"I applied for the SBI Cashback Credit Card 3–4 times, but each time my application was rejected instantly. The first time I applied was around June 2024, then again in September, December, and finally in April 2025. Every time, the application was rejected without providing any specific reason. I even emailed them to understand the cause, but the response was the usual: “Rejected due to internal policy.”

At the time, my CIBIL score was over 775+ and my monthly salary was around ₹2 lakh, so I believed I met the eligibility criteria. Still, I kept facing rejection.

Later, I visited an SBI branch, and a representative from the credit card team mentioned that I already had multiple credit cards and was ""over-leveraged,"" which might be the reason for rejection. That explanation didn’t make much sense to me, having multiple credit cards isn’t a valid reason for rejection, especially if I'm paying my bills on time and maintaining a strong credit score.

I was also using the SBI SimplySAVE Credit Card, which I had originally applied for during a sale season when they were offering the SBI ELITE card. However, I declined the ELITE card due to its ₹5,000 joining fee and opted for the SimplySAVE card instead. Later, when I emailed them to upgrade my SimplySAVE card to the Cashback card, they declined. Oddly enough, they were willing to upgrade me to the SBI ELITE card again. I found this confusing if I’m eligible for a premium card like ELITE, why am I being denied a basic Cashback card?

To resolve this, I suggested two options:

Either upgrade my existing card to the Cashback card, or

Close my current SBI card and accept a fresh Cashback card application—this way, I wouldn't be taking on more credit, just maintaining the existing ₹2 lakh limit.

Yet, they refused again.

Eventually, I filed a complaint on the PG Portal (pgportal.gov.in). The SBI Nodal Officer responded and kept asking for my salary slip multiple times, but each time a different representative would follow up. After 20 days, on 22nd May, they closed the ticket saying, “We cannot upgrade to the Cashback card. You may apply separately, subject to approval” which was the same issue I had raised in the complaint.

After the ticket was closed, I got a call from the PG Portal team asking if my issue was resolved. I told them it wasn’t, and they updated the comment on the ticket. Soon after, I received an email from SBI for verification. They didn’t respond for a few days, but my video KYC was finally completed on 26th May. During this, they also offered me one Lifetime Free (LTF) credit card for a family member.

The verification was done, and I was told the card would be delivered in 3–4 days. However, there was no update. Around 5th June (after about 10 days), I received another call for verification. The card was finally approved on 9th June, and I received the e-card with credit limit 2.6 lakh. The physical card took another week to dispatch and was finally delivered on 16th June.

Zepto automatically adds a ₹9 Zepto Pass to your cart. If you try to remove it, they hit you with a guilt trap:

(A) Yes, I want to save (B) No, I want to pay more

But here’s the shady part — if you don’t take the pass, you’re slapped with a ₹20 processing fee, even though the actual processing cost is only ₹10. So one way or another, you’re paying extra — either for the pass or through a fee that covers it anyway.

Even if you do buy Zepto Pass, you need a minimum cart value of ₹199 for free delivery. And even after that, you’re often charged a processing fee, and sometimes surge fees, rain fees, or other creatively named charges — some of which are maybe waived if you’re lucky.

I’m not against companies making profits — but this level of manipulative pricing, hidden costs, and psychological nudging is borderline unethical.

Consolidation Sets In: Following a sharp 4% surge in early May, Nifty logged two consecutive weeks of mild losses (-0.67% and -0.41%). This suggests consolidation rather than a reversal, as markets digest recent gains and await fresh triggers. Key Supports Hold Firm: Despite weakness, the index held above crucial technical markers — the 5-EMA on the weekly and 20-EMA on the daily chart. Market breadth, however, remained narrow, with just 14% of NSE stocks ending in the green, reflecting underlying caution.

Sectoral Pressure Builds: Friday saw broad-based declines led by Metals, IT, and Commodities, each falling over 1%. The weakness points to waning momentum in cyclicals and export-linked sectors after recent outperformance.

So I just sold my 3bhk in Noida for 2.07 cr. Will be getting around 2 cr Net in hand after all deductions.

I have a special child so I need to invest very carefully.

No ltcg will be there as I bought a flat in faridabad recently so ltcg will be adjusted there.

I will be buying 3 1rk flats for around 50 lakhs total which will give monthly rental income of 30k.

Rest 1.5 cr I would like to invest to get good returns. Monthly income: Rs 1 lakh which goes towards rent and my son's physiotherapy and other stuff. No monthly saving at present.

30k rent from 1rk will be my savings from next month onwards. Total 30k will be saving every month from now on.

Liabilities: Nil Loans: Nil

Extra Money: bank 15 lakhs (emergency fund) Stocks: 25 lakhs wife Mutual funds: 20 lakhs.

I have other properties which value 70 lakhs at the moment but don't wanna sell them since they give good rental income every month.

Additionally I make around 2 lakhs every year through commission by selling properties in Gurgaon.

We have plans to adopt a girl within next 5-6 months so we need to make sure we have ample funds for future.

Wife left high paying job to take care of son and I can't take a high paying job because I need to take leaves often from office for my son and other stuff.

So please guide me on how to utilise this 1.5 cr in best possible way.
